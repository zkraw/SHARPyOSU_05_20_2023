Induced Velocity Derivatives
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


Calculate derivatives of induced velocity.

Methods:

- eval_seg_exp and eval_seg_exp_loop: profide ders in format
    [Q_{x,y,z},ZetaPoint_{x,y,z}]
  and use fully-expanded analytical formula.
- eval_panel_exp: iterates through whole panel

- eval_seg_comp and eval_seg_comp_loop: profide ders in format
    [Q_{x,y,z},ZetaPoint_{x,y,z}]
  and use compact analytical formula.
