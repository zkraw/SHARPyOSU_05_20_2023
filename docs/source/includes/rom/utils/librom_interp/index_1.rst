Methods for the interpolation of DLTI ROMs
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


This is library for  state-space models interpolation. These routines are intended
for small size state-space models (ROMs), hence some methods may not be optimised
to exploit sparsity structures. For generality purposes, all methods require in
input interpolatory weights.


The module includes the methods:

    - :func:`~sharpy.rom.utils.librom_interp.transfer_function`: returns an interpolatory state-space model based on the
      transfer function method [1]. This method is general and is, effectively, a
      wrapper of the :func:`sharpy.linear.src.libss.join` method.

    - :func:`~sharpy.rom.utils.librom_interp.BT_transfer_function`: evolution of transfer function methods. The growth of
      the interpolated system size is avoided through balancing.
